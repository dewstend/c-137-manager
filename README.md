# C-137 Manager
Simple CRUD app using Node.js, React + Material UI. It also has Sequelize with SQLite3.
I made this as a technical challenge for an interview with the app idea and starting data.

Server design and implementation by me.

Client implementation by me.


## Setup
Install the server's dependencies

    yarn
    // or
    npm install
    
Install the client's dependencies.

    cd ./client
    yarn
    // or
    npm install

Initialize and populate the database with the CLI tool.

    yarn initialize
    // or
    npm run initialize
    
**Warning**: Initializing will wipe out existing data.
